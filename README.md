# Predicting_Credit_Default

Predicting probability of credit card default using customer demographic data and recent payment history using R.

Using at data set from the University of Taiwan of 5000 Bank of Taiwan credit customers, our team was able to correctly identify approximately 50% of defaults in a test subsection of the data. Our boosted tree model outpreformed a variety of other models including a random forest, ridge regression, and logistic regression.

Attached is the R code for the various models we tested and a PowerPoint presentation outlining our process, challenges, and conclusions.
